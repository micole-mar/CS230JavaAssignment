COMPSCI230 Semester 2 2023: 

The complete application is a bouncing program designed to allow different shapes to move around along various paths. Users will be able to create shapes based on the classes you will write, and they can also select individual existing shapes on the panel and modify their properties. This project consists of THREE iterations, each of which will be treated as a separate assignment.
